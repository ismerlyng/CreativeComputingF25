        <h1>Breakup Lessons from Reddit (and Maybe You)</h1>
        <p> Below is a curated collection of posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/">r/BreakUps Reddit thread</a>. As you scroll, you will see lessons that I have taken away from the users' stories. Read and see if you agree. At the end of this page, I invite you to add your own breakup story or one you might have heard (remain anonymous please) and determine what lesson you gleaned from it. </p>
