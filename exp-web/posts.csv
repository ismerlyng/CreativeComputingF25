To the ones who left because there was “no more spark”,"Let’s be honest. Relationships aren’t fueled by constant fireworks. They need effort, communication, and the decision to stay even when things feel off. If the spark faded, why not speak up? Why not work through it together instead of slowly checking out?

You talked to your friends about how things didn’t feel the same, but you couldn’t tell the one person who deserved the truth. You could have asked, ""What can we do to fix this?"" Instead, you silently backed away and ran when things got real.

Here’s the thing. Long-term love doesn’t always feel magical. Sometimes it just feels steady and safe. That comfort is not a sign to leave. It’s something people wish they had. The spark won’t always be there on its own. It takes effort to keep it alive.",Honeymoon phase doesn't last forever
"This message is for the girl who was told they would marry you, and was totally blinded by the switch up…","Chances are if this happened to you, just like it happened to me.. you've already spent a ton of time crying. Sorry to tell ya, you were hoodwinked by someone with totally broken inner workings. It's NOT normal to go all in and flip. It's diagnosable, in fact. It was not you. You don't need to be more. This person ain't right. So STOP wasting time on them. Get pissed off, and get justice by giving yourself everything that they couldn't. Glow up- no, rise up like a phoenix out of the ashes. Believe me when I tell you, living better than well is the BEST revenge.",Glowing up is revenge
Your ex sucks simply because they made themself your ex,"I will never, ever chase or beg someone like that again. It's literally a turn off now and for that I am actually thankful for what I went through. I recently met an amazing guy who's actually communicative and kind and intentional about what he wants and it's awesome. Who knows what will come of it, but it does prove one thing- that there ARE other people out there who will want and show up for you. All you can do is feel your feelings, heal, and get comfortable on your own. Good things will come your way when you treat yourself and others well. I promise!",There are other fish in the sea
Here are some things I learned from my last relationship that I will NEVER allow in my next one…,"Never will I ever:

-Date an emotionally unavailable or Dismissive Avoidant man. -Allow someone to Trauma dump on me. -Allow a man to decide my worth. -Date a man who is not sure of me. -Ask for closure from someone who dumps me by text. -Date a man who lacks empathy and can switch into cold and stoic. -Date a man who has the grass is greener syndrome. -Date a man who does not know what he wants. -Date a man who has an idealized version of how a partner/ relationship should look like instead of being open to build it. -Date a man who is unhealed from past trauma, and is unaware and not working on it. -Date a man who runs from his fears and insecurities instead of facing them and becoming a better man.

Add to the list if you have things you have learned too…",Figure out who NOT to date
She’s not coming back boys.,"She’s never coming back to you. a woman does not leave a man she sees a future with. She has already thought about this for weeks or longer. Do not contact her or beg for her back, The hardest truth is that she probably already has someone on the side. And even if she doesn’t, she will definitely be seeing other guys soon. Women are different, they know what they want and she did not choose you. So do yourself a favor and let her go. It’s gonna hurt for a while but you’ll come out stronger than ever. Don’t worry about the cliche bullshit everyone tells you to do, none of that works. You’re just gonna have to accept the pain and deal with it untill it’s gone. No amount of distraction is gonna take ur mind off it, that’s just facts. you’ll make it through, I did. And when you feel yourself wanting to reach out, just remember, if she wanted to SHE WOULD. Stay strong fellas.",Don't chase your ex
Guys I’ve done it,"I finally think I’ve taken the first step to finally moving on from her, I broke no contact (I know blasphemy) but I had so much I had to say and get off my chest. I told her how much I love her and that I know I fucked up and that I think she deserves the world and I’ll have to let go of her. I told her I’d always be there for her if she ever needed anything and that I hope her new man treats her the best.

I finally got to say everything my mind had been spewing for the past months, everything my heart ached about. I got to say goodbye in a way that felt right to me and end it in a mature manner. I also finally deleted the pictures of her I had saved permanently and unfollowed people who kept posting her because it was eating away at me. It was terrifying and made me feel physically sick, when I saw that she read it i legitimately threw my phone away from me and started shaking; but I did it guys.",You can find closure
"To the girls left suddenly, silently, and without closure—this is for you.","But real love doesn’t disappear. It doesn’t ghost, confuse, or make you feel disposable. So you chose not to beg, not to chase. You walked away with quiet strength, even when your heart was breaking.

Yes, it hurts. Healing isn’t about forgetting—it’s about reclaiming your power. The love you gave was real. And now, that love belongs to you.

One day, the ache will fade. You’ll smile again, naturally. And love will find you—clear, consistent, and true.

Until then, be kind to yourself. You are not too much. You are not hard to love. The right person will never leave you wondering.

Keep choosing and loving yourself.",Self-love matters more
how long have you gone not checking your ex’s social media?,"i’ve gotten myself through over a week of refusing to look at anything, blocked everywhere to stop my curiosity from getting the best of me. i won’t act like i don’t care or that i’m not anxious to discover there’s someone new but after finding something nasty and disrespectful on their instagram a week ago i’ve decided to protect my peace.

disciplining myself is long overdue; i try to occupy myself with thoughts about my future that i’m building, getting enthusiastic about upcoming plans, reminding myself about assignments i should get working on. i am often bored and find myself disassociating with the physical world/reality and wondering what my ex might be up to but i’ve stopped trying to find out, so the curiosity or search for certainty has died down a little",Looking at their Instagram doesn't help
Anyone else still haunted by a version of themselves they lost in love?,"The worst part wasn’t that she left.
It was that she took with her the only version of me that still believed in love.

It’s been months, and I still feel like I’ll never get that part of me back.",A part of you may have stayed with them
My ex who broke up with me six years ago text me last night,"She texted me last night. Let’s call her by her first initial, J. She said she was sorry for leaving me and that after all this time she realized that I’m the one and that God wants us to be together. I’ve been long over her though. I told her that I didn’t just let go of her, I let go of the version of myself that was in love with her and I realized that I’m worth more than breadcrumbs and I am worth more than someone who had to leave me in order to realize what she lost. I let her know that I was really hurt that she cheated on me multiple times. I’m pretty sure a young version of me, 18 or 19 year old me would have been happy to hear that from her but it’s too late. Besides, I just got dumped by my most recent girlfriend over four months ago. Even if I wanted to get back with J (which I don’t) I have a lot of healing to do. She’s also not the same person that I met back in 2018. She changed a lot and not in good ways.

Why do exes do this?",They may or may not come back
Letting go of an ex gets easy when you do this,"Letting go of an ex is difficult because of emotional attachment.

It’s the only reason why so many people struggle with this.

Logically they all know that it’s wrong to chase, to let this person back in, that things will never be the same with the ex and maybe even that the ex is only going to hurt them all over again.

Emotionally though, they can’t resist the pull of going back to what feels safe or familiar.",Familiar isn't always safe
Sometimes moving on takes time and that’s OK,"My ex broke up with me more than 8 months ago now, and I still haven’t been able to move on. He broke up with me over reasons I still don’t understand very well and I think about him everyday, almost all the time. He’s moved on now, has someone new in his life, but I still find myself crying over him at night every now and then. I didn’t cheat on him, didn’t abuse him, never told anyone anything bad about him. He was the light of my life, my everything. I could have died for him.

I really wish I could be able to move on too, but I can’t. I have put myself in question many many times and I have been wondering what’s wrong with me.

But that’s OK.

After going through some really dark times, I have now accepted that I might never get over him, because I am too loyal and because I have so much love for him, even if he hurt me and doesn’t want me in his life anymore. I am trying to make peace with that. But it takes time. And that’s ok.

People often say healing is not a linear process. I believe that’s true. I also believe that in some cases it’s a never ending process. Sometimes you only know one true love and the pain you feel once it’s over is the only thing that remains from that love.",Healing isn't linear
what i learned 3 months post breakup,"the turning point for me was when i saw him recently at a party and saw how happy he was, seeing him smile and laugh so much without me. seeing the smile that i fell in love with, i realized that if he’s happier now, then i’m glad he made this decision for himself.

seeing him in person made all the anger go away, and now i can finally say that i really do want him to be happy. and if he’s happier without me then i hope he doesn’t come back. i never understood when people said i hope my absence gives you the peace my presence couldn’t, but now i can see how some people are just not meant to stay together.",They might be better off without you
Story of my life,"You can't disappoint a woman multiple times and expect her to still want you. Some men treat their women terribly and then call them disloyal when they leave. You can't expect a woman who gets hurt repeatedly to stay just because you keep saying you'll change and you're sorry. A woman loses interest when she constantly has to remind you how she wants to be treated. Consistency should come naturally, not be forced. Eventually, she'll get tired and move on with her life. The only reason she stayed as long as she did was that a small part of her believed you would do better. A woman will do anything and everything to make her relationship work. But even the kindest hearts have limits.",They left because they were tired
Why you keep reconciling but can’t stay together,"Simply put, it happens because patterns are stronger than feelings.

Here’s what I mean by this.

The attraction can consistently be on point, you can both love each other to death and the intimacy can be out of this world.

But, all of that means nothing and you would never be able to move it beyond a toxic/casual/non-committal/low quality relationship if none or just one of you consistently behaves in a way that allows for something like a healthy, monogamous, stable and thriving high quality relationship to exist.",Relationships require unlearning
I’m Devastated. DO NOT GO BACK.,"I went through the worst heartbreak. I could’ve sworn he would never talk to me again. He did and we hooked up. By a stroke of fate I ran into him and his new partner. He seems to be in love and I seem to be sick. He cheated on her with me. But, he won’t leave her. He loves her too much. I can’t help to start to feel that he never loved me. He said it but his actions didn’t show it. You don’t hurt someone you love the way he hurt me. You don’t hurt another human being the way that he hurt me. Now, I’m back to square one, because I opened back up. I was just reflecting on how I was much better from the beginning and now BOOM. It’s my own fault for being so stupid. No, you don’t want to get back with them. Yes, no contact is the safest option. It feels worst because I really was moving forward. At least now, I know, we are done done. It’s over over. That is it it.",Trying again might be delusional
"They are not thinking about you. Chill out, go outside, or go to bed.","They dont think about you ever. They are fully aware that you are not apart of their life and they do not care. Dont inhale copium thinking theyll circle back around. They wont. You will stay blocked, stay on read, or stay on delivered until the end of time. It is over. Thats it. What is done is done. They may have cared about you at some point, but it is completely over now. They have moved on, probably with someone new, and that person is the only person they think about when they want to be intimate. You never cross their mind. Get over it, and move on.",Just accept that it's over
If you knew 100% that a breakup was pending would you delay its end?,"As above. You can rip the Bandaid off now. Or push it a day or a week or a month later. No option to make it permanent. It will end. And the time between now and then would be as bumpy as ever.

Would you suck it up, bite the bullet and allow your partner to end it or would you (if possible) avoid rocking the boat with some confidence that the status quo would remain temporarily but eventually you’ll have to endure that pain? The pain is essentially the same in all cases.

My mom said rip the bandaid off but if it will be the same pain regardless. I’d prefer to squeeze out another hour to avoid that feeling.",Don't delay an impending breakup
Get off the dating apps,"These apps are so dumb. Nobody on there can measure up to your ex and if you’re freshly out of a relationship it’s the worst place to be.

At least it is for me. That’s why I’m off - made me feel better to just leave it alone, but that’s just me!

Hope everybody is okay! Remember to focus on yourself more than your ex and rely on friends / family",Maybe hold off on the dating apps
