                <ul class="verse">
                    <li>My husband has given away my hairbands</li>
                    <li>in my dream to the young women he works with,</li>
                    <li>my black velvet, my mauve, my patent leather one,</li>
                    <li>the olive band with the magenta rose</li>
                    <li>whose paper petals crumple in the drawer,</li>
                    <li>the flowered crepe, the felt with a rickrack</li>
                    <li>of vines, the twined mock-tortoise shells.</li>
                    <li>He says I do not need them, I’ve cut my hair,</li>
                    <li>so it no longer falls in my eyes when I read,</li>
                    <li>or when we are making love and I bend over him.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>But no, I tell him, you do not understand,</li>
                    <li>I want my hairbands even if I don’t need them.</li>
                    <li>These are the trophies of my maidenhood,</li>
                    <li>the satin dress with buttons down the back,</li>
                    <li>the scented box with the scalloped photographs.</li>
                    <li>This is my wild-haired girlhood dazzled with stories</li>
                    <li>of love, the romantic heroine with the pale, operatic face</li>
                    <li>who throws herself on the train tracks of men’s arms.</li>
                    <li style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">These are the chastened girl-selves I gave up</span></li>
                    <li style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">to become the woman who could be married to you.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>But every once in a while, I pull them out</li>
                    <li>of my dresser drawer and touch them to my cheek,</li>
                    <li>worn velvet and faded silk, <span style="font-style: italic;">mi tesoro</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">mi juventud</span>—</li>
                    <li>which my husband has passed on to the young women</li>
                    <li>who hold for him the promise of who I was.</li>
                    <li>And in my dream I weep real tears that wake me up</li>
                    <li>to my husband sleeping beside me that deep sleep</li>
                    <li>that makes me tremble thinking of what is coming.</li>
                    <li>And I slip out of bed to check that they are still mine,</li>
                    <li>my crumpled rose, my mauve, my black hairbands.</li>
